## About This Project

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- git clone this repository
- composer install
- cp env .env.example
- Add and supply these keys to env file
    SIGNAL_WIRE_SPACE="xxxxx.signalwire.com"
    SIGNAL_WIRE_PROJECT="xxxxx"
    SIGNAL_WIRE_TOKEN="xxxxx"
- php artisan db:wipe && php artisan migrate:refresh && php artisan db:seed
- login user: client@client.com pass: adminadmin
